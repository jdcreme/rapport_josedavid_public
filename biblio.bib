  abstract = {Theoretical ideas and experimental results concerning high-temperature
	superconductors are reviewed. Special emphasis is given to calculations
	performed with the help of computers applied to models of strongly
	correlated electrons proposed to describe the two-dimensional CuO2
	planes. The review also includes results using several analytical
	techniques. The one- and three-band Hubbard models and the t?J model
	are discussed, and their behavior compared against experiments when
	available. The author found, among the conclusions of the review,
	that some experimentally observed unusual properties of the cuprates
	have a natural explanation through Hubbard-like models. In particular,
	abnormal features like the mid-infrared band of the optical conductivity
	?(?), the new states observed in the gap in photoemission experiments,
	the behavior of the spin correlations with doping, and the presence
	of phase separation in the copper oxide superconductors may be explained,
	at least in part, by these models. Finally, the existence of superconductivity
	in Hubbard-like models is analyzed. Some aspects of the recently
	proposed ideas to describe the cuprates as having a dx2?y2 superconducting
	condensate at low temperatures are discussed. Numerical results favor
	this scenario over others. It is concluded that computational techniques
	provide a useful, unbiased tool for studying the difficult regime
	where electrons are strongly interacting, and that considerable progress
	can be achieved by comparing numerical results against analytical
	predictions for the properties of these models. Future directions
	of the active field of computational studies of correlated electrons
	are briefly discussed.},

	abstract = {We introduce a variational state for one-dimensional two-orbital Hubbard models that intuitively explains the recent computational discovery of pairing in these systems when hole doped. Our ansatz is an optimized linear superposition of Affleck–Kennedy–Lieb–Tasaki valence-bond states, rendering the combination a valence-bond liquid dubbed orbital resonant valence bond. We show that the undoped (one-electron/orbital) quantum state of two sites coupled into a global spin singlet is exactly written employing only spin-1/2 singlets linking orbitals at nearest-neighbor sites. Generalizing to longer chains defines our variational state visualized geometrically expressing our chain as a two-leg ladder, with one orbital per leg. As in Anderson’s resonating valence-bond state, our undoped variational state contains preformed singlet pairs that via doping become mobile, leading to superconductivity. Doped real materials with one-dimensional substructures, two near-degenerate orbitals, and intermediate Hubbard U/W strengths—W the carrier’s bandwidth—could realize spin-singlet pairing if on-site anisotropies are small. If these anisotropies are robust, spin-triplet pairing emerges.},

Usually, a biquadratic spin operator is added to the HDVV Hamiltonian to account for such deviations. It is shown here that this operator cannot describe the effect of the excited atomic non-Hund states which brought the most important contribution to the deviations. For systems containing more than two magnetic centers, non-Hund states cause additional interactions that are of the same order of magnitude as the biquadratic exchange and should have significant effects on the macroscopic properties of extended systems.},

	abstract = {This paper analyzes the different contributions to the magnetic coupling in systems with more than one unpaired electron per center. While in S = 1 ∕ 2 spin systems the Heisenberg Hamiltonian involving only bilinear exchange interactions is reliable for the description of the magnetic states, biquadratic exchange interactions must be sometimes introduced for S = 1 (or higher) spin systems to account for isotropic deviations to Heisenberg behavior. The analysis establishes that the excited atomic states, the so-called non-Hund states, are responsible for the main contribution to the deviations. The kinetic exchange contribution and the spin, hole, and particle polarizations increase the magnetic coupling but essentially maintain the Heisenberg pattern. The importance of the different contributions has been studied for a series of Ni 2 compounds with a polarizable double azido bridge. The coupling between two Fe 3 + ions in the molecular crystal Na 3 Fe S 3 , which is known experimentally to present large deviations to Heisenberg behavior, has also been investigated.},

	abstract = {A series of accurate ab initio calculations on CupOq finite clusters, properly embedded in the Madelung potential of the infinite lattice, have been performed in order to determine the local effective interactions in the CuO2 planes of La2−xSrxCuO4 compounds. The values of the first-neighbor interactions, magnetic coupling (JNN=125 meV), and hopping integral (tNN=−555 meV) have been confirmed. Important additional effects are evidenced, concerning essentially the second-neighbor hopping integral tNNN=+110 meV, the displacement of a singlet toward an adjacent colinear hole, habcSD=−80 meV, a non-negligible hole-hole repulsion VNN−VNNN=0.8 eV, and a strong anisotropic effect of the presence of an adjacent hole on the values of the first-neighbor interactions. The dependence of JNN and tNN on the position of neighbor hole(s) has been rationalized from the two-band model and checked from a series of additional ab initio calculations. An extended t−J model Hamiltonian has been proposed on the basis of these results. It is argued that the here-proposed three-body effects may play a role in the charge/spin separation observed in these compounds, that is, in the formation and dynamic of stripes.},
