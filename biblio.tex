	and methods utilized in this study, creating a universal relationship
	for longitudinal polarizability. This can be explained by examining
	the terms in the sum over states equation used to determine polarizability
	and noting that the vast majority of the polarizability arises from
	a few elements near the band gap. This universal trend is then used

  journal = {International Journal of Quantum Chemistry},
  year = {1998},
  volume = {68},
  pages = {1--52},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {It is demonstrated that frequency-dependent response functions can
	conveniently be derived from the time-averaged quasienergy. The variational
	criteria for the quasienergy determines the time-evolution of the
	wave-function parameters and the time-averaged time-dependent HellmannâFeynman
	theorem allows an identification of response functions as derivatives
	of the quasienergy. The quasienergy therefore plays the same role
	as the usual energy in time-independent theory, and the same techniques
	can be used to obtain computationally tractable expressions for response
	properties, as for energy derivatives in time-independent theory.
	This includes the use of the variational Lagrangian technique for
	obtaining expressions for molecular properties in accord with the
	2n+1 and 2n+2 rules. The derivation of frequency-dependent response
	properties becomes a simple extension of variational perturbation
	theory to a Fourier component variational perturbation theory. The
	generality and simplicity of this approach are illustrated by derivation
	of linear and higher-order response functions for both exact and
	approximate wave functions and for both variational and nonvariational
	wave functions. Examples of approximate models discussed in this
	article are coupled-cluster, self-consistent field, and second-order
	MÃ¸llerâPlesset perturbation theory. A discussion of symmetry properties
	of the response functions and their relation to molecular properties
	is also given, with special attention to the calculation of transition-
	and excited-state properties.Â Â© 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Int

	storage in various systems for the large-scale application of fuel
	cells, mobiles and for automotive uses. Hectic materials research
	is going on throughout the world with various adsorption mechanisms
	to increase the storage capacity. It was observed that physisorption
	proves to be an effective way for this purpose. Some of the materials
	in this race include graphite, zeolite, carbon fibers and nanotubes.
	Among all these, the versatile material carbon nanotube (CNT) has
	a number of favorable points like porous nature, high surface area,
	hollowness, high stability and light weight, which facilitate the
	hydrogen adsorption in both outer and inner portions. In this work
	we have considered armchair (5,5), zig zag (10,0) and chiral tubes
	(8,2) and (6,4) with and without structural defects to study the
	physisorption of hydrogen on the surface of carbon nanotubes using
	DFT calculations. For two different H 2 configurations, adsorption
	binding energies are estimated both for defect free and defected
	carbon nanotubes. We could observe larger adsorption energies for
	the configuration in which the hydrogen molecular axis perpendicular
	to the hexagonal carbon ring than for parallel to C?C bond configuration
	corresponding to the defect free nanotubes. For defected tubes the
	adsorption energies are calculated for various configurations such
	as molecular axis perpendicular to a defect site octagon and parallel
	to C?C bond of octagon and another case where the axis perpendicular
	to hexagon in defected tube. The adsorption binding energy values
	are compared with defect free case. The results are discussed in

  abstract = {We document recent improvements in the efficiency of our implementation
	in the Amsterdam Density Functional program (ADF) of the response
	equations in time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). Applications
	to quasi one-dimensional polyene chains and to three-dimensional
	water clusters show that, using our all-electron atomic orbital (AO)-based
	implementation, calculations of excitation energies and (hyper)polarizabilities
	on molecules with several hundred atoms and several thousand basis
	functions are now feasible, even on (a small cluster of) personal
	computers. The matrix elements, which are required in TDDFT, are
	calculated on an AO basis and the same linear scaling techniques
	as used in ADF for the iterative solution of the KohnâSham (KS)
	equations are applied to the determination of these matrix elements.
	Near linear scaling is demonstrated for this part of the calculation,
	which used to be the time-determining step. Transformations from
	the AO basis to the KS orbital basis and back exhibit N3 scaling,
	but due to a very small prefactor this N3 scaling is still of little
	importance for currently accessible system sizes. The main CPU bottleneck
	in our current implementation is the multipolar part of the Coulomb
	potential, scaling quadratically with the system size. It is shown

	of 3.9, 5.5, 7.0, and 6.8 Ã, were investigated. The adsorption binding
	energy of H atoms depends on H occupancy, tube diameter, and helicity
	(or chirality), as well as endohedral (interior) vs exohedral (exterior)
	binding. Exohedral binding energies are substantially higher than
	endohedral binding energies due to easier sp2âsp3 transition in
	hybridization of carbon on exterior walls upon binding. A binding
	energy as low as â8.9 kcal/mol is obtained for 2H atoms on the
	exterior wall of a (5, 0) SWNT. The binding energies of H atoms on
	the metallic SWNT are significantly weaker (about 23 kcal/mol weaker)
	than that on the semiconductor SWNT, for both endohedral and exohedral
	adsorption. The binding energy is generally higher on SWNTs of larger
	diameters, while its dependence on H occupancy is relatively weak
	except at very low occupancies. Experimental results at 298 K and
	for pressures up to 10 MPa with a carbon-bridged composite material
	containing SWNTs demonstrate the presence of multiple adsorption
	sites based on desorption hysteresis for the spiltover H on SWNTs,
	and the experimental results were in qualitative agreement with the
	molecular orbital calculation results. },

  abstract = {The study of the manganese oxides, widely known as manganites, that
	exhibit the “colossal” magnetoresistance effect is among the
	main areas of research within the area of strongly correlated electrons.
	After considerable theoretical effort in recent years, mainly guided
	by computational and mean-field studies of realistic models, considerable
	progress has been achieved in understanding the curious properties
	of these compounds. These recent studies suggest that the ground
	states of manganite models tend to be intrinsically inhomogeneous
	due to the presence of strong tendencies toward phase separation,
	typically involving ferromagnetic metallic and antiferromagnetic
	charge and orbital ordered insulating domains. Calculations of the
	resistivity versus temperature using mixed states lead to a good
	agreement with experiments. The mixed-phase tendencies have two origins:
	(i) electronic phase separation between phases with different densities
	that lead to nanometer scale coexisting clusters, and (ii) disorder-induced
	phase separation with percolative characteristics between equal-density
	phases, driven by disorder near first-order metal–insulator transitions.
	The coexisting clusters in the latter can be as large as a micrometer
	in size. It is argued that a large variety of experiments reviewed
	in detail here contain results compatible with the theoretical predictions.
	The main phenomenology of mixed-phase states appears to be independent
	of the fine details of the model employed, since the microscopic
	origin of the competing phases does not influence the results at
	the phenomenological level. However, it is quite important to clarify
	the electronic properties of the various manganite phases based on
	microscopic Hamiltonians, including strong electron–phonon {Jahn–Teller}
	and/or Coulomb interactions. Thus, several issues are discussed here
	from the microscopic viewpoint as well, including the phase diagrams
	of manganite models, the stabilization of the charge/orbital/spin
	ordered half-doped correlated electronics ({CE)-states}, the importance
	of the naively small Heisenberg coupling among localized spins, the
	setup of accurate mean-field approximations, the existence of a new
	temperature scale T∗ where clusters start forming above the Curie
	temperature, the presence of stripes in the system, and many others.
	However, much work remains to be carried out, and a list of open
	questions is included here. It is also argued that the mixed-phase
	phenomenology of manganites may appear in a large variety of compounds
	as well, including ruthenates, diluted magnetic semiconductors, and
	others. It is concluded that manganites reveal such a wide variety
	of interesting physical phenomena that their detailed study is quite
	important for progress in the field of correlated electrons.},

  abstract = {In this review the double exchange ({DE)} model forming a basis for
	the description of the physics of colossal magnetoresistance manganites
	is discussed. For a limiting case of exchange interaction which is
	large compared with the band width, the effective Hamiltonian of
	the {DE} model is derived from that of the sd-exchange model. Since
	this Hamiltonian is very complicated, the dynamical mean field approximation,
	successful for other strongly correlated systems, is found to be
	more suitable for describing the model of interest. Two simplified
	versions of the {DE} model, both capable of accounting for a wide
	range of physical properties, are proposed — one using classical
	localized spins and the other involving quantum spins but no transverse
	spin fluctuations. A temperature–electron concentration phase diagram
	for a system with consideration for the domain of phase separation
	is constructed, whose basic features are shown to be in qualitative
	agreement with experimental data for the manganites, as also are
	the temperature and electron concentration dependences of their electrical
	resistivity, magnetization, and spectral characteristics. At the
	quantitative level, introducing additional electron–lattice interaction
	yields a good agreement. A number of yet unresolved problems in the
	physics of manganites, including the mechanism of temperature- or
	doping-induced metal–insulator phase transition and the nature
	of charge ordering, are also discussed. By comparing predictions
	made by computing approach with the experimental data, the adequacy
	of the {DE} model is assessed and its drawbacks are analyzed. Numerous
	recent theoretical studies of the unique properties of this broad
	class of strongly correlated systems are summarized in this review.},

	studies of the ground and low-lying excited states of uniform and

	to obtain low-temperature thermodynamic properties of the system.
	The ground state of a {2N} spin system with spin-1 and spin- alternating
	from site to site and interacting via an antiferromagnetic exchange
	is found to be ferrimagnetic with total spin {sG=N/2} from both {DMRG}
	and spin wave analysis. Both the studies also show that there is
	a gapless excitation to a state with spin {sG-1} and a gapped excitation
	to a state with spin {sG+1.} Surprisingly, the correlation length
	in the ground state is found to be very small from both the studies
	for this gapless system. For this very reason, we show that the ground
	state can be described by a variational ansatz of the product type.
	{DMRG} analysis shows that the chain is susceptible to a conditional
	spin-Peierls' instability. The {DMRG} studies of magnetization, magnetic
	susceptibility (χ), and specific heat show strong magnetic-field
	dependence. The product {χT} shows a minimum as a function of temperature
	(T) at low-magnetic fields and the minimum vanishes at high-magnetic
	fields. This low-field behavior is in agreement with earlier experimental
	observations. The specific heat shows a maximum as a function of
	temperature and the height of the maximum increases sharply at high-magnetic
	fields. It is hoped that these studies will motivate experimental
	studies at high-magnetic fields.},

  abstract = {The study of the manganese oxides, widely known as manganites, that
	exhibit the âcolossalâ magnetoresistance effect is among the
	main areas of research within the area of strongly correlated electrons.
	After considerable theoretical effort in recent years, mainly guided
	by computational and mean-field studies of realistic models, considerable
	progress has been achieved in understanding the curious properties
	of these compounds. These recent studies suggest that the ground
	states of manganite models tend to be intrinsically inhomogeneous
	due to the presence of strong tendencies toward phase separation,
	typically involving ferromagnetic metallic and antiferromagnetic
	charge and orbital ordered insulating domains. Calculations of the
	resistivity versus temperature using mixed states lead to a good
	agreement with experiments. The mixed-phase tendencies have two origins:
	(i) electronic phase separation between phases with different densities
	that lead to nanometer scale coexisting clusters, and (ii) disorder-induced
	phase separation with percolative characteristics between equal-density
	phases, driven by disorder near first-order metalâinsulator transitions.
	The coexisting clusters in the latter can be as large as a micrometer
	in size. It is argued that a large variety of experiments reviewed
	in detail here contain results compatible with the theoretical predictions.
	The main phenomenology of mixed-phase states appears to be independent
	of the fine details of the model employed, since the microscopic
	origin of the competing phases does not influence the results at
	the phenomenological level. However, it is quite important to clarify
	the electronic properties of the various manganite phases based on
	microscopic Hamiltonians, including strong electronâphonon {JahnâTeller}
	and/or Coulomb interactions. Thus, several issues are discussed here
	from the microscopic viewpoint as well, including the phase diagrams
	of manganite models, the stabilization of the charge/orbital/spin
	ordered half-doped correlated electronics ({CE)-states}, the importance
	of the naively small Heisenberg coupling among localized spins, the
	setup of accurate mean-field approximations, the existence of a new
	temperature scale Tâ where clusters start forming above the Curie
	temperature, the presence of stripes in the system, and many others.
	However, much work remains to be carried out, and a list of open
	questions is included here. It is also argued that the mixed-phase
	phenomenology of manganites may appear in a large variety of compounds
	as well, including ruthenates, diluted magnetic semiconductors, and
	others. It is concluded that manganites reveal such a wide variety
	of interesting physical phenomena that their detailed study is quite
	important for progress in the field of correlated electrons.},

  abstract = {In this review the double exchange ({DE)} model forming a basis for
	the description of the physics of colossal magnetoresistance manganites
	is discussed. For a limiting case of exchange interaction which is
	large compared with the band width, the effective Hamiltonian of
	the {DE} model is derived from that of the sd-exchange model. Since
	this Hamiltonian is very complicated, the dynamical mean field approximation,
	successful for other strongly correlated systems, is found to be
	more suitable for describing the model of interest. Two simplified
	versions of the {DE} model, both capable of accounting for a wide
	range of physical properties, are proposed â one using classical
	localized spins and the other involving quantum spins but no transverse
	spin fluctuations. A temperatureâelectron concentration phase diagram
	for a system with consideration for the domain of phase separation
	is constructed, whose basic features are shown to be in qualitative
	agreement with experimental data for the manganites, as also are
	the temperature and electron concentration dependences of their electrical
	resistivity, magnetization, and spectral characteristics. At the
	quantitative level, introducing additional electronâlattice interaction
	yields a good agreement. A number of yet unresolved problems in the
	physics of manganites, including the mechanism of temperature- or
	doping-induced metalâinsulator phase transition and the nature
	of charge ordering, are also discussed. By comparing predictions
	made by computing approach with the experimental data, the adequacy
	of the {DE} model is assessed and its drawbacks are analyzed. Numerous
	recent theoretical studies of the unique properties of this broad
	class of strongly correlated systems are summarized in this review.},

	in the hole-doped Ni-oxide chain compound Y2-{xCaxBaNiO}5 [G. Xu
	et al., Science 289, 419 (2000)]. Here a two orbital model for this
	material is studied using computational techniques. Spin {IC} is
	observed in a wide range of densities and couplings. The phenomenon
	originates in antiferromagnetic correlations âacross holesâ dynamically
	generated to improve hole movement, as it occurs in the one-dimensional
	Hubbard model and in recent studies of the two-dimensional extended

	studies of the ground and low-lying excited states of uniform and
	dimerized alternating spin chains. The {DMRG} procedure is also employed
	to obtain low-temperature thermodynamic properties of the system.
	The ground state of a {2N} spin system with spin-1 and spin- alternating
	from site to site and interacting via an antiferromagnetic exchange
	is found to be ferrimagnetic with total spin {sG=N/2} from both {DMRG}
	and spin wave analysis. Both the studies also show that there is
	a gapless excitation to a state with spin {sG-1} and a gapped excitation
	to a state with spin {sG+1.} Surprisingly, the correlation length
	in the ground state is found to be very small from both the studies
	for this gapless system. For this very reason, we show that the ground
	state can be described by a variational ansatz of the product type.
	{DMRG} analysis shows that the chain is susceptible to a conditional
	spin-Peierls' instability. The {DMRG} studies of magnetization, magnetic
	susceptibility (Ï), and specific heat show strong magnetic-field
	dependence. The product {ÏT} shows a minimum as a function of temperature
	(T) at low-magnetic fields and the minimum vanishes at high-magnetic
	fields. This low-field behavior is in agreement with earlier experimental
	observations. The specific heat shows a maximum as a function of
	temperature and the height of the maximum increases sharply at high-magnetic
	fields. It is hoped that these studies will motivate experimental
	studies at high-magnetic fields.},

	Quantum Monte Carlo simulation results on larger lattices are also

	to various types of order (ranging from ??standard?? staggered spin
	order to more ??exotic?? possibilities like chiral order), as well
	as various dynamical properties of these models. Upper bounds for
	the critical hole doping (xc), where long-range antiferromagnetic
	order disappears, are presented. It was found that xc is very small
	in agreement with experiments for the high-Tc superconductors. For
	example, in the t-J model, xc{\textless}0.08 at J/t=0.4. However,
	short-distance spin correlations are important up to much higher
	dopings producing a sharp well-defined spin-wave-like peak in S(q=(?,?),?).
	Regarding the possibility of phase separation in the Hubbard model,
	we have studied the behavior of the density of particles, ?n?, as
	a function of the chemical potential, using the Lanczos method on
	a 4×4 Hubbard cluster, finding no indications of phase separation
	for any value of U/t. Then, we conclude that the t-J model at small
	J/t should not phase separate.},

	Ni site of S=1 Haldane chain compound Y2BaNiO5. 89Y nuclear-magnetic
	resonance (NMR) allows us to measure the local magnetic susceptibility
	at different distances from the defects. The 89Y NMR spectrum consists
	of one central peak and several less intense satellite peaks. The
	central peak represents the chain sites far from the defect. Its
	shift measures the uniform susceptibility, which displays a Haldane
	gap ??100K and it corresponds to an antiferromagnetic (AF) coupling
	J?260K between the nearest neighbor Ni spins. Zn or Cu substitution
	does not affect the Haldane gap. The satellites, which are evenly
	distributed on the two sides of the central peak, probe the antiferromagnetic
	staggered magnetization near the substituted site. The spatial variation
	of the induced magnetization is found to decay exponentially from
	the impurity for both Zn and Cu for T{\textgreater}50K. Its extension
	is found identical for both impurities and corresponds accurately
	to the correlation length ?(T) determined by Monte Carlo simulations
	for the pure compound. In the case of nonmagnetic Zn, the temperature
	dependence of the induced magnetization is consistent with a Curie
	law with an ?effective? spin S=0.4 on each side of Zn. This staggered
	effect is quantitatively well accounted for in all the explored range
	by quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) computations of the spinless-defect-induced
	magnetism. In the case of magnetic Cu, the similarity of the induced
	magnetism to the Zn case implies a weak coupling of the Cu spin to
	the nearest-neighbor Ni spins. The slight reduction of about 20?30\%
	of the induced polarization with respect to Zn is reproduced by QMC
	computations by considering an antiferromagnetic coupling of strength
	J?=0.1J?0.2J between the S=1/2 Cu spin and nearest-neighbor Ni spin.
	Macroscopic susceptibility measurements confirm these results as
	they display a clear Curie contribution due to the impurities nearly
	proportional to their concentration. This contribution is indeed
	close to that of two spin half for Zn substitution. The Curie contribution
	is smaller in the Cu case, which confirms that the coupling between
	Cu and near-neighbor Ni is antiferromagnetic.},

The code development is centered on common XML and HDF5 data formats,         libraries to simplify and speed up code development, common evaluation and plotting tools, and simulation programs. The programs enable non-experts to start carrying out serial or parallel numerical simulations  by providing basic implementations of the important algorithms for quantum lattice models: classical and  quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) using non-local updates, extended ensemble simulations, exact and full          diagonalization (ED), the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) both in a static version and a      dynamic time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) code, and quantum Monte Carlo solvers for dynamical mean    field theory (DMFT). The ALPS libraries provide a powerful framework for programmers to develop their own applications, which, for instance, greatly simplify the steps of porting a serial code onto a parallel,   distributed memory machine. Major changes in release 2.0 include the use of HDF5 for binary data,         evaluation tools in Python, support for the Windows operating system, the use of CMake as build system    and binary installation packages for Mac OS X and Windows, and integration with the VisTrails workflow    provenance tool.

	Special emphasis is given to the influence of the Coulomb repulsion
	on the regions of phase separation recently discovered in this family

	ground state. When phase separation dominates at V=0, the Coulomb

	in agreement with several experimental results, as discussed in the

	values of V. In the ferromagnetic regime close to density n=0.5,
	the Coulomb interaction induces tendencies to charge ordering without
	altering the fully polarized character of the state. This regime
	of ?charge-ordered ferromagnetism? may be related with experimental
	observations of a similar phase by Chen and Cheong [Phys. Rev. Lett.

	in realistic models for manganites analyzed with unbiased many-body

	The comparison of the calculated spectrum to those predicted by the

	considers a purely magnetic oxygen or the Girerd-Papaefthymiou double-exchange
	model. An additional significant improvement is obtained when different
	antiferromagnetic contributions are combined with the double-exchange
	model, showing that the Zener polaron spectrum is actually ruled
	by a refined double-exchange mechanism where non-Hund atomic states
	play a non-negligible role. Finally, eight states of a different
	nature have been found to be intercalated in the double-exchange
	spectrum. These states exhibit an O to Mn charge transfer, implying
	a second O 2p orbital of approximate ? character instead of the usual

	the nature of the low- lying excitations, but also?according to Kohn?s
	theory [W. Kohn, Phys. Rev.133, A171 (1964)]?from a different organization
	of the electrons in their ground state: electrons are localized in
	insulators and delocalized in metals. We adopt a quantitative measure
	of such localization, by means of a ?localization length? ? , finite
	in insulators and divergent in metals. We perform simulations over
	a one-dimensional binary alloy model, in a tight-binding scheme.
	In the ordered case the model is either a band insulator or a band
	metal, whereas in the disordered case it is an Anderson insulator.
	The results show indeed a localized/delocalized ground state in the
	insulating/metallic cases, as expected. More interestingly, we find
	a significant difference between the two insulating cases: band versus
	Anderson. The insulating behavior is due to two very different scattering
	mechanisms; we show that the corresponding values of ? differ by
	a large factor for the same alloy composition. We also investigate
	the organization of the electrons in the many body ground state from
	the viewpoint of the density matrices and of Boys? theory of localization.},

	The many-body ground wavefunction of any insulator is characterized

	which sharply characterizes the insulating state of matter. The theory

	anions in the solid phase. The stability of the 2,6,10-tris(diethylamino)-4,8,12-trioxatriangulenium
	ion 5a is expressed as the pKR+ value, which is determined in strongly
	basic nonaqueous solution on the basis of a new acidity function
	C\_. The pKR+ value of 5a is measured to be 19.7, which is 10 orders
	of magnitude higher than the values found for the most stable carbenium

	a novel dimeric iron compound, which is shown to possess a central
	exchange?coupled delocalized?valence Fe(II/III) pair. Complete delocalization
	of the excess electron in the dimeric iron center is concluded from
	the indistinguishability of the two iron sites in Mössbauer spectroscopy.
	Mössbauer, EPR, and magnetic susceptibility data imply a system spin
	S t =9/2 for the ground state. This finding is explained as being
	a consequence of the double?exchange interaction which is generated
	by the delocalized electron. Experimental values obtained from UV?VIS,
	Mössbauer, and EPRspectroscopy are for the double?exchange parameter
	B=1300 cm? 1, the g factorsg x,y =2.04 and g z =2.3, the parameters
	for zero?field splitting D=4 cm? 1 and E?0 cm? 1, and for the hyperfine

	first excited state a spin?octet with an excitation energy ?\&gt;175
	cm? 1. From this value a lower bound of ?235 cm? 1 has been deduced
	for the exchange?coupling constant J. In the framework of a simplified
	description of the iron atoms by unperturbed 3d orbitals, the values
	of the Atensor components as well as the quadrupole splitting ?E
	Q can be interpreted in a consistent manner by assuming the excess
	electron being delocalized over two d ? orbitals centered at the
	two iron sites of the dimer and directed along the iron?iron axis
	as the z direction.},

	with the electron density was found for the local density of states
	(LDOS), at the impurity except when the impurity, at half filling,
	is close to a mixed- valence regime. Next, in the central part of
	this paper, we studied the effects of finite Hubbard interaction

	drives the impurity into a more defined Kondo regime although accompanied
	in most cases by a reduction of the spectral weight of the impurity
	LDOS. Again, for the impurity in the mixed-valence regime, we observed
	an interesting nonmonotonic behavior. We also concluded that the
	conductance, computed for a small finite bias applied to the leads,
	follows the behavior of the impurity LDOS, as in the case of noninteracting

	a binuclear FeIIIFeIII iron complex connected to two metallic electrodes.
	During the transport process, the FeIIIFeIII dimer undergoes a one-electron
	reduction (Coulomb blockade transport regime), leading to the reduced
	mixed- valence FeII FeIII species. For such a system, the additional
	electron may be fully delocalized leading to the stabilization of
	the highest spin ground state S = 9/2 by the double exchange mechanism,
	while the original FeIIIFeIII has usually an S = 0 spin ground state
	due to the antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between the two FeIII
	ions. Intuitively, the spin delocalization within the mixed-valence
	complex may be thought to favor charge and spin transport through
	the molecule between the two metallic electrodes. Contrary to such
	an intuitive concept, we find that the increased delocalization leads
	in fact to a blocking of the transport, if the exchange coupling
	interaction within the FeIIIFeIII dimer is antiferromagnetic. This
	is due to the violation of the spin angular momentum conservation,
	where a change of half a unit of spin (?S = 1/2) is allowed between
	two different redox states of the molecule. The result is explained
	in terms of a double-exchange blockade mechanism, triggered by the
	interplay between spin delocalization and antiferromagnetic coupling
	between the magnetic cores. Consequently, ferromagnetically coupled
	dimers are shown not to be affected by the double-exchange blockade
	mechanism. The situation is evocative of the onset and removal of
	giant magnetoresistance in the conductance of diamagnetic layers,
	as a function of the relative alignment of the magnetization of two
	weakly antiferromagnetically coupled ferromagnetic contacts. Numerical
	simulations accounting for the effect of vibronic coupling show that
	the spin current increases as a function of spin delocalization in
	Class I and Class II mixed-valence dimers. The signature of vibronic
	coupling on sequential spin-tunneling processes through Class I and

  abstract = {The exact density functional for the ground-state energy is strictly
	self-interaction- free (i.e., orbitals demonstrably do not self-interact),
	but many approximations to it, including the local-spin-density (LSD)
	approximation for exchange and correlation, are not. We present two
	related methods for the self-interaction correction (SIC) of any
	density functional for the energy; correction of the self-consistent
	one-electron potenial follows naturally from the variational principle.
	Both methods are sanctioned by the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. Although
	the first method introduces an orbital-dependent single-particle
	potential, the second involves a local potential as in the Kohn-Sham
	scheme. We apply the first method to LSD and show that it properly
	conserves the number content of the exchange-correlation hole, while
	substantially improving the description of its shape. We apply this
	method to a number of physical problems, where the uncorrected LSD
	approach produces systematic errors. We find systematic improvements,
	qualitative as well as quantitative, from this simple correction.
	Benefits of SIC in atomic calculations include (i) improved values
	for the total energy and for the separate exchange and correlation
	pieces of it, (ii) accurate binding energies of negative ions, which
	are wrongly unstable in LSD, (iii) more accurate electron densities,
	(iv) orbital eigenvalues that closely approximate physical removal
	energies, including relaxation, and (v) correct longrange behavior
	of the potential and density. It appears that SIC can also remedy
	the LSD underestimate of the band gaps in insulators (as shown by
	numerical calculations for the rare-gas solids and CuCl), and the
	LSD overestimate of the cohesive energies of transition metals. The
	LSD spin splitting in atomic Ni and s?d interconfigurational energies
	of transition elements are almost unchanged by SIC. We also discuss
	the admissibility of fractional occupation numbers, and present a
	parametrization of the electron-gas correlation energy at any density,
	based on the recent results of Ceperley and Alder.},

	exchange and purely magnetic Heisenberg configurations. This Hubbard
	model can either be mapped on a purely magnetic Heisenber model in
	which the bridging oxygen is also magnetic or on a double exchange
	model owing to the hybridization of the magnetic and ligand or bitals.
	The purely magnetic Heisenberg model is analytically solved in the
	general case of two metals (having n magnetic orbitals) bridged by
	a magnetic oxygen. The comparison of the analytical expressions of
	the Heisenberg energies to those of the double exchange model reveals
	that the two model spectra are identical except for one state which
	does not belong to the model space of the double exchange Hamiltonian.
	Consequently, the fitting of the model spectra to accurate ab initio
	spectra does not discriminate between the physically different models.
	These concepts are illustrated for the Mn?O?Mn unit (or Zener polaron)
	found in the half-doped manganite Pr 0.6 Ca 0.4 Mn O 3 . It is shown
	that in the present case the projections of the ab initioground statewave
	function onto both model spaces are almost identical provided that

	Simulations) project, an open source software project to develop
	libraries and application programs for the simulation of strongly

	is centered on common XML and HDF5 data formats, libraries to simplify
	and speed up code development, common evaluation and plotting tools,
	and simulation programs. The programs enable non-experts to start
	carrying out serial or parallel numerical simulations by providing
	basic implementations of the important algorithms for quantum lattice
	models: classical and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) using non-local updates,
	extended ensemble simulations, exact and full diagonalization (ED),
	the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) both in a static
	version and a dynamic time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) code,
	and quantum Monte Carlo solvers for dynamical mean field theory (DMFT).
	The ALPS libraries provide a powerful framework for programmers to
	develop their own applications, which, for instance, greatly simplify
	the steps of porting a serial code onto a parallel, distributed memory
	machine. Major changes in release 2.0 include the use of HDF5 for
	binary data, evaluation tools in Python, support for the Windows
	operating system, the use of CMake as build system and binary installation
	packages for Mac OS X and Windows, and integration with the VisTrails
	workflow provenance tool. The software is available from our web

	The results show indeed a localized/delocalized ground state in the

	a significant difference between the two insulating cases: band versus
	Anderson. The insulating behavior is due to two very different scattering

	with surprisingly high superconducting transition temperatures Tc,

	between antiferromagnetism and superconductivity. Stripes are associated
	with the highly organized form of electron matter. When a hole moves
	through a dynamical spin system, it causes severe spin frustrations
	that in turn frustrate the free motion of the hole. A single hole
	can only propagate as a quasiparticle because of the presence of
	quantum spin fluctuations repairing the damage in the spin background.
	However, when the density of holes is finite, they can help each
	other repairing the spin damage by concerting their motions. This
	gives rise to the complex ordering phenomena called ?stripes.? The
	formation of stripes may be described with the help of the t?J model.
	When a hole is injected in a 2D S = 1/2 antiferromagnet, it leaves
	behind a string of flipped spins that delocalizes the ?magnetic string.?
	These violate the antiparallel registry of the spins, thereby frustrating
	the delocalization of the hole. At finite hole densities, the holes
	can coordinate their motions in such a way that they help each other
	to avoid the frustrating magnetic strings. An individual hole may
	now move sideways without causing a misoriented spin and by repeating
	these hops kinks propagate along the stripe that cause the stripe
	as a whole to move freely over the plane, unimpeded by the spin system.},

	with the electron density was found for the local density of states
	(LDOS), at the impurity except when the impurity, at half filling,

	this paper, we studied the effects of finite Hubbard interaction

	drives the impurity into a more defined Kondo regime although accompanied
	in most cases by a reduction of the spectral weight of the impurity
	LDOS. Again, for the impurity in the mixed-valence regime, we observed
	an interesting nonmonotonic behavior. We also concluded that the
	conductance, computed for a small finite bias applied to the leads,
	follows the behavior of the impurity LDOS, as in the case of noninteracting

	available. The author found, among the conclusions of the review,
	that some experimentally observed unusual properties of the cuprates
	have a natural explanation through Hubbard-like models. In particular,
	abnormal features like the mid-infrared band of the optical conductivity
	?(?), the new states observed in the gap in photoemission experiments,
	the behavior of the spin correlations with doping, and the presence
	of phase separation in the copper oxide superconductors may be explained,
	at least in part, by these models. Finally, the existence of superconductivity
	in Hubbard-like models is analyzed. Some aspects of the recently
	proposed ideas to describe the cuprates as having a dx2?y2 superconducting
	condensate at low temperatures are discussed. Numerical results favor
	this scenario over others. It is concluded that computational techniques
	provide a useful, unbiased tool for studying the difficult regime
	where electrons are strongly interacting, and that considerable progress
	can be achieved by comparing numerical results against analytical
	predictions for the properties of these models. Future directions
	of the active field of computational studies of correlated electrons

  abstract = {The study of the manganese oxides, widely known as manganites, that
	exhibit the ?colossal? magnetoresistance effect is among the main
	areas of research within the area of strongly correlated electrons.
	After considerable theoretical effort in recent years, mainly guided
	by computational and mean-field studies of realistic models, considerable
	progress has been achieved in understanding the curious properties
	of these compounds. These recent studies suggest that the ground
	states of manganite models tend to be intrinsically inhomogeneous
	due to the presence of strong tendencies toward phase separation,
	typically involving ferromagnetic metallic and antiferromagnetic
	charge and orbital ordered insulating domains. Calculations of the
	resistivity versus temperature using mixed states lead to a good
	agreement with experiments. The mixed-phase tendencies have two origins:
	(i) electronic phase separation between phases with different densities
	that lead to nanometer scale coexisting clusters, and (ii) disorder-induced
	phase separation with percolative characteristics between equal-density
	phases, driven by disorder near first-order metal?insulator transitions.
	The coexisting clusters in the latter can be as large as a micrometer
	in size. It is argued that a large variety of experiments reviewed
	in detail here contain results compatible with the theoretical predictions.
	The main phenomenology of mixed-phase states appears to be independent
	of the fine details of the model employed, since the microscopic
	origin of the competing phases does not influence the results at
	the phenomenological level. However, it is quite important to clarify
	the electronic properties of the various manganite phases based on
	microscopic Hamiltonians, including strong electron?phonon Jahn?Teller
	and/or Coulomb interactions. Thus, several issues are discussed here
	from the microscopic viewpoint as well, including the phase diagrams
	of manganite models, the stabilization of the charge/orbital/spin
	ordered half-doped correlated electronics (CE)-states, the importance
	of the naively small Heisenberg coupling among localized spins, the
	setup of accurate mean-field approximations, the existence of a new
	temperature scale T? where clusters start forming above the Curie
	temperature, the presence of stripes in the system, and many others.
	However, much work remains to be carried out, and a list of open
	questions is included here. It is also argued that the mixed-phase
	phenomenology of manganites may appear in a large variety of compounds
	as well, including ruthenates, diluted magnetic semiconductors, and
	others. It is concluded that manganites reveal such a wide variety
	of interesting physical phenomena that their detailed study is quite
	important for progress in the field of correlated electrons.},

	in a confining potential as in the Ising limit. The bandwidth of
	the hole is linear in J in the region 0.1?J?0.4 although a power-law
	behavior is not excluded. The spectral weight of the quasiparticle
	grows like J0.5 in the same region. We present new analytical results

	theory it can be shown that the momentum of the hole at large J/t

	for lattices with 8 and 10 sites. A quasiparticle is also observed

	Ni site of S=1 Haldane chain compound Y2BaNiO5. 89Y nuclear-magnetic
	resonance (NMR) allows us to measure the local magnetic susceptibility
	at different distances from the defects. The 89Y NMR spectrum consists
	of one central peak and several less intense satellite peaks. The
	central peak represents the chain sites far from the defect. Its
	shift measures the uniform susceptibility, which displays a Haldane
	gap ??100K and it corresponds to an antiferromagnetic (AF) coupling
	J?260K between the nearest neighbor Ni spins. Zn or Cu substitution
	does not affect the Haldane gap. The satellites, which are evenly
	distributed on the two sides of the central peak, probe the antiferromagnetic
	staggered magnetization near the substituted site. The spatial variation
	of the induced magnetization is found to decay exponentially from
	the impurity for both Zn and Cu for T{\textgreater}50K. Its extension
	is found identical for both impurities and corresponds accurately
	to the correlation length ?(T) determined by Monte Carlo simulations
	for the pure compound. In the case of nonmagnetic Zn, the temperature
	dependence of the induced magnetization is consistent with a Curie
	law with an ?effective? spin S=0.4 on each side of Zn. This staggered
	effect is quantitatively well accounted for in all the explored range
	by quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) computations of the spinless-defect-induced
	magnetism. In the case of magnetic Cu, the similarity of the induced
	magnetism to the Zn case implies a weak coupling of the Cu spin to
	the nearest-neighbor Ni spins. The slight reduction of about 20?30\%
	of the induced polarization with respect to Zn is reproduced by QMC
	computations by considering an antiferromagnetic coupling of strength
	J?=0.1J?0.2J between the S=1/2 Cu spin and nearest-neighbor Ni spin.
	Macroscopic susceptibility measurements confirm these results as
	they display a clear Curie contribution due to the impurities nearly
	proportional to their concentration. This contribution is indeed
	close to that of two spin half for Zn substitution. The Curie contribution
	is smaller in the Cu case, which confirms that the coupling between
	Cu and near-neighbor Ni is antiferromagnetic.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses some effects of mobile electrons in some antiferromagnetic
	lattices. It is shown that these electrons (or holes) always give
	rise to a distortion of the ground state spin arrangement, since
	electron transfer lowers the energy by a term of first order in the
	distortion angles. In the most typical cases this results in: (a)
	a nonzero spontaneous moment in low fields; (b) a lack of saturation
	in high fields; (c) simultaneous occurrence of "ferromagnetic" and
	"antiferromagnetic" lines in neutron diffraction patterns; (d) both
	ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic branches in the spin wave spectra.
	Some of these properties have indeed been observed in compounds of
	mixed valency such as the manganites with low Mn4+ content. Similar
	considerations apply at finite temperatures, at least for the (most
	widespread) case where only the bottom of the carrier band is occupied
	at all temperatures of interest. The free energy is computed by a
	variational procedure, using simple carrier wave functions and an
	extension of the molecular field approximation. It is found that
	the canted arrangements are stable up to a well-defined temperature
	T1. Above T1 the system is either antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic,
	depending upon the relative amount of mobile electrons. This behavior
	is not qualitatively modified when the carriers which are responsible
	for double exchange fall into bound states around impurity ions of
	opposite charge. Such bound states, however, will give rise to local
	inhomogeneities in the spin distortion, and to diffuse magnetic peaks
	in the neutron diffraction pattern. The possibility of observing
	these peaks and of eliminating the spurious spin-wave scattering
	is discussed in an Appendix.},

  abstract = {We formulate a quasiparticle theory for a single hole in a quantum
	antiferromagnet in the limit that the Heisenberg exchange energy
	is much less than the hopping matrix element, J?t. We consider the
	ground state of the spins to be either a quantum Néel state or a
	d-wave resonating-valence-bond (RVB) state. We show in a self-consistent
	perturbation theory that the hole spectrum is strongly renormalized
	by the interactions with spin excitations. The hole can be described
	by a narrow quasiparticle band located at an energy of order -t with
	a quasiparticle residue of order J/t and a bandwidth of order J.
	Above the quasiparticle band is an incoherent band of width of order
	t. Our results indicate that the energy scale for any coherent phenomenon
	involving the holes is ?J, where ? is the doping concentration. In
	the Néel state we perform a spin-wave expansion on an anisotropic
	Heisenberg model. In the Ising limit we reproduce previously known
	results and then expand perturbatively about that limit. In this
	expansion we find that the holes have a quasiparticle residue of
	Jz/t and a bandwidth of J?. In the Heisenberg limit we employ a ??dominant

  abstract = {The Total Position Spread (TPS) tensor, defined as the second moment
	cumulant of the position operator, is a key quantity to describe
	the mobility of electrons in a molecule or an extended system. In
	the present investigation, the partition of the TPS tensor according
	to spin variables is derived and discussed. It is shown that, while
	the spin-summed TPS gives information on charge mobility, the spin-partitioned
	TPS tensor becomes a powerful tool that provides information about
	spin fluctuations. The case of the hydrogen molecule is treated,
	both analytically, by using a 1s Slater-type orbital, and numerically,
	at Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) level with a V6Z basis set.
	It is found that, for very large inter-nuclear distances, the partitioned
	tensor growths quadratically with the distance in some of the low-lying
	electronic states. This fact is related to the presence of entanglement
	in the wave function. Non-dimerized open chains described by a model
	Hubbard Hamiltonian and linear hydrogen chains H n (n ? 2), composed
	of equally spaced atoms, are also studied at FCI level. The hydrogen
	systems show the presence of marked maxima for the spin-summed TPS
	(corresponding to a high charge mobility) when the inter-nuclear
	distance is about 2 bohrs. This fact can be associated to the presence
	of a Mott transition occurring in this region. The spin-partitioned
	TPS tensor, on the other hand, has a quadratical growth at long distances,
	a fact that corresponds to the high spin mobility in a magnetic system.},

  abstract = {We analyze symmetry mixing in the superconducting (SC) order parameter
	of planar cuprates. The behavior of thermal conductivity observed
	in some systems doped with magnetic impurities or in some systems
	exposed to external magnetic field seems to indicate that such symmetry
	mixing takes place. We discuss this phenomenon in the framework of
	the spin polaron model (SPM). We assume that antiferromagnetic (AF)
	correlations, which are at least of short range, tend to confine
	motion of holes which have been created in the AF spin background.
	The nature of the propagation of quasiparticles which are hole-like
	and the nature of the interaction between quasiparticles is determined
	by a tendency to restore the local AF order. It is known that two
	holes in the t ?J model (tJ M) form bound states with dx 2?y2 or
	p-wave symmetry. The d-wave bound state has lower energy and is the
	ground state. The mixing of d-wave symmetry with p-wave symmetry
	takes place in the SC order parameter at some range of finite values
	of the doping parameter. That range lies at the applicability verge
	of the SPM, where AF correlation are already very short. On the other
	hand, these correlations may be strengthened by above mentioned external
	factors, which seems to explain why symmetry mixing is observed in
	this case. (© 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim)},

	Special emphasis is given to the influence of the Coulomb repulsion
	on the regions of phase separation recently discovered in this family

	ground state. When phase separation dominates at V=0, the Coulomb
	interaction breaks the large domains of the two competing phases

	in agreement with several experimental results, as discussed in the

	in the spin structure factor as incommensurate peaks, even at large
	values of V. In the ferromagnetic regime close to density n=0.5,
	the Coulomb interaction induces tendencies to charge ordering without
	altering the fully polarized character of the state. This regime
	of ?charge-ordered ferromagnetism? may be related with experimental
	observations of a similar phase by Chen and Cheong [Phys. Rev. Lett.

	in realistic models for manganites analyzed with unbiased many-body

  abstract = {An outline is given of the model for some high-temperature superconductors
	which assumes that the carriers are holes in the (hybridized) oxygen
	2p band and form ?spin polarons? with the moments on the copper atoms.
	A comparison is made with observations of spin polarons in Gd3-x
	v x S4 and with the properties of La1-x Sr x VO3 in relation to those
	of La2-x Sr x CuO4. It is assumed, following several authors, that
	in the superconductors the polarons form bipolarons, which are bosons,
	and a comparison is made with some other treatments of this hypothesis.
	It is proposed that in many such superconductors the boson, essentially
	a pair of these holes, moves in an impurity band, and that normally
	all the polarons (fermions) form bipolarons; the fermions repel each
	other on the same site (positive Hubbard U) but attract when on adjacent
	sites; the critical temperature T c is then that at which the Bose
	gas becomes non-degenerate. In such materials a non-degenerate gas
	of bosons would carry the current above T c as first suggested by
	Alexandrov et al. (1986). The linear increase in the resistivity
	above T c is explained on this hypothesis. The effective mass of
	the bipolaron is, we believe, large (?20?30m e). The copper 3d9 moments
	in the superconducting range resonate between their two orientations
	as a consequence of the motion of the carriers, as they do in the
	description by Brinkman and Rice (1970) of highly correlated metals.
	Spin polarons, we believe, form only when this is so, but not in
	the antiferromagnetic range of x. A discussion is given of the resistivity
	above T c, thermopower above T c, and of the nature of the superconducting
	gap as shown by tunnelling. We confine our discussion to the materials

  abstract = {The concept of spin?orbital entanglement on superexchange bonds in
	transition metal oxides is introduced and explained on several examples.
	It is shown that spin?orbital entanglement in superexchange models
	destabilizes the long-range (spin and orbital) order and may lead
	either to a disordered spin-liquid state or to novel phases at low
	temperature which arise from strongly frustrated interactions. Such
	novel ground states cannot be described within the conventionally
	used mean field theory which separates spin and orbital degrees of
	freedom. Even in cases where the ground states are disentangled,
	spin?orbital entanglement occurs in excited states and may become
	crucial for a correct description of physical properties at finite
	temperature. As an important example of this behaviour we present
	spin?orbital entanglement in the RV O3 perovskites, with R = La,Pr,?,Y
	b,Lu, where the finite temperature properties of these compounds
	can be understood only using entangled states: (i) the thermal evolution
	of the optical spectral weights, (ii) the dependence of the transition
	temperatures for the onset of orbital and magnetic order on the ionic
	radius in the phase diagram of the RV O3 perovskites, and (iii) the
	dimerization observed in the magnon spectra for the C-type antiferromagnetic
	phase of Y V O3. Finally, it is shown that joint spin?orbital excitations
	in an ordered phase with coexisting antiferromagnetic and alternating
	orbital order introduce topological constraints for the hole propagation
	and will thus radically modify the transport properties in doped
	Mott insulators where hole motion implies simultaneous spin and orbital

	The ground state of a 2N spin system with spin-1 and spin- alternating
	from site to site and interacting via an antiferromagnetic exchange
	is found to be ferrimagnetic with total spin sG=N/2 from both DMRG
	and spin wave analysis. Both the studies also show that there is

	to a state with spin sG+1. Surprisingly, the correlation length in
	the ground state is found to be very small from both the studies
	for this gapless system. For this very reason, we show that the ground
	state can be described by a variational ansatz of the product type.
	DMRG analysis shows that the chain is susceptible to a conditional
	spin-Peierls' instability. The DMRG studies of magnetization, magnetic
	susceptibility (?), and specific heat show strong magnetic-field
	dependence. The product ?T shows a minimum as a function of temperature
	(T) at low-magnetic fields and the minimum vanishes at high-magnetic
	fields. This low-field behavior is in agreement with earlier experimental

	self-interaction- free (i.e., orbitals demonstrably do not self-interact),
	but many approximations to it, including the local-spin-density (LSD)
	approximation for exchange and correlation, are not. We present two
	related methods for the self-interaction correction (SIC) of any
	density functional for the energy; correction of the self-consistent
	one-electron potenial follows naturally from the variational principle.
	Both methods are sanctioned by the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. Although
	the first method introduces an orbital-dependent single-particle
	potential, the second involves a local potential as in the Kohn-Sham
	scheme. We apply the first method to LSD and show that it properly
	conserves the number content of the exchange-correlation hole, while
	substantially improving the description of its shape. We apply this
	method to a number of physical problems, where the uncorrected LSD
	approach produces systematic errors. We find systematic improvements,
	qualitative as well as quantitative, from this simple correction.
	Benefits of SIC in atomic calculations include (i) improved values
	for the total energy and for the separate exchange and correlation

  abstract = {At variance with what happens in metals, the electronic charge in
	insulators cannot flow freely under an applied dc field, and undergoes
	instead static polarization. These two features arise from the difference
	in nature of the excitation spectra, but also from the difference
	in organization of the electrons in their ground state: electrons
	are localized in insulators and delocalized in metals. Such localization,
	however, is hidden in a rather subtle way in the many-body wavefunction.
	We review the theory of the insulating state, on the basis of electron
	localization, addressing on the same basis all insulators: either
	independent electron or correlated, either crystalline or disordered.
	The starting point is a 1964 milestone paper by Kohn. Significant
	advances occurred from 1999 onwards. These advances are deeply rooted
	in the modern theory of polarization: localization and polarization
	can be regarded as two aspects of the same phenomenon, and stem from
	essentially the same formalism. Starting from the many-body ground
	wavefunction, one defines a dimensionless complex number which vanishes
	in metals and is finite in insulators; in the latter case, its phase
	(the Berry phase) yields the macroscopic polarization, while its
	modulus measures localization. Conductivity features are addressed

	hopping matrix elements between localized states in extended systems.
	We apply the scheme to the determination of double exchange (DE)
	parameters in lightly hole-doped LaMnO3 and electron-doped CaMnO3.
	DE is one of the important factors for understanding the properties
	of doped manganites. The calculations are based on the construction
	of wave functions for localized hole states or localized electron
	states for large embedded clusters. The wave functions of these clusters
	are expressed in terms of localized orbitals, obtained from calculations
	on smaller units, or ?fragments,? centered around a transition metal
	ion. The starting point of electronic states expressed in terms of
	localized orbital sets is conceptually attractive. It also allows
	for a rigorous treatment of local electron correlation and electronic
	relaxation effects. In the present study, the fragments are embedded
	[MnO6] units. The large clusters contain either two or four Mn ions
	and all neighboring oxygen ligands. The results are compared with
	conventional embedded cluster calculations. In both compounds, the
	effective hopping matrix elements, or ?double exchange? (DE) parameters,
	in the ab planes (in the Pbnm space group) are larger than along
	the c axes. We found nearly perfect agreement with the Anderson?Hasegawa
	model for the spin dependence of the DE parameters. Nearest-neighbor
	parameters are more than one order of magnitude larger than next
	nearest-neighbor parameters. In LaMnO3 the DE in the ab planes is
	? ?0.26 eV. If there were no Jahn?Teller distortion present in the
	material, it would have been twice as large. In CaMnO3, the corresponding
	nearest-neighbor DE parameter for hopping of a doped electron in
	the ab planes is only ? ?0.17 eV, due to the antiparallel spin coupling.
	However, since this interaction is much larger than the exchange
	coupling, we suggest that it induces local ferromagnetic clusters
	around the doped electrons. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Int J

	are generated by subtle interplay between quantum many-body effects
	and spin-independent Coulomb interactions between electrons. It is
	a challenging problem to verify this scenario in the Hubbard model,
	which is an idealized model for strongly interacting electrons in
	a solid. s ferromagnetism is a well-known rigorous example of ferromagnetism
	in the Hubbard model. It deals with the limiting situation in which
	there is one fewer electron than in the half-filling and the on-site
	Coulomb interaction is infinitely large. There are relatively new
	rigorous examples of ferromagnetism in Hubbard models called flat-band
	ferromagnetism. Flat-band ferromagnetism takes place in carefully
	prepared models in which the lowest bands (in the single-electron
	spectra) are ?flat.? Usually, these two approaches are regarded as
	two complimentary routes to ferromagnetism in the Hubbard model.
	resent paper we describe Nagaoka's ferromagnetism and flat-band ferromagnetism
	in detail, giving all the necessary background as well as complete
	(but elementary) mathematical proofs. By studying an intermediate
	model called the long-range hopping model, we also demonstrate that
	there is indeed a deep relation between these two seemingly different
	approaches to ferromagnetism. er discuss some attempts to go beyond
	these approaches. We briefly discuss recent rigorous example of ferromagnetism
	in the Hubbard model which has neither infinitely large parameters
	nor completely flat bands. We give preliminary discussion regarding
	possible experimental realizations of the (nearly-)flat- band ferromagnetism.
	Finally, we focus on some theoretical attempts to understand metallic
	ferromagnetism. We discuss three artificial one-dimensional models
	in which the existence of metallic ferromagnetism can be easily proved.

	in mind readers who are new to the field. Although the present paper

	quarter century has been the problem of high-temperature superconductivity
	in hole-doped copper-oxide compounds. Fundamental to this problem
	is the competition between antiferromagnetic spin correlations, a
	symptom of strong Coulomb interactions, and the kinetic energy of
	the doped carriers, which favors delocalization. After discussing
	some of the early challenges in the field, I describe the experimental
	picture provided by a variety of spectroscopic and transport techniques.
	Then I turn to the technique of neutron scattering, and discuss how
	it is used to determine spin correlations, especially in model systems
	of quantum magnetism. Neutron scattering and complementary techniques
	have determined the extent to which antiferromagnetic spin correlations
	survive in the cuprate superconductors. One experimental case involves
	the ordering of spin and charge stripes. I first consider related
	measurements on model compounds, such as La 2?x Sr x NiO 4+? , and
	then discuss the case of La 2?x Ba x CuO 4 . In the latter system,
	recent transport studies have demonstrated that quasi-two-dimensional
	superconductivity coexists with the stripe order, but with frustrated
	phase order between the layers. This has led to new concepts for
	the coexistence of spin order and superconductivity. While the relevance
	of stripe correlations to high-temperature superconductivity remains
	a subject of controversy, there is no question that stripes are an
	intriguing example of electron matter that results from strong correlations.},

	based on the t?J model. An exact expression of the energy spectrum
	is obtained, in which the irreparable phase string effect [Phys.
	Rev. Lett. 77, 5102 (1996)] is explicitly present. By identifying
	the phase string effect with spin backflow, we point out that spin-charge
	separation must exist in such a system: the doped hole has to decay
	into a neutral spinon and a spinless holon, together with the phase
	string. We show that while the spinon remains coherent, the holon
	motion is deterred by the phase string, resulting in its localization
	in space. We calculate the electron spectral function which explains
	the line shape of the spectral function as well as the ?quasiparticle?
	spectrum observed in angle-resolved photoemission experiments. Other
	analytic and numerical approaches are discussed based on the present
	framework.},

  abstract = {The density matrix renormalization (DMRG) group method for ladders
	works much more efficiently with open boundary conditions. One consequence
	of these boundary conditions is ground-state charge density oscillations
	that often appear to be nearly constant in magnitude or to decay
	only slightly away from the boundaries. We analyze these using bosonization
	techniques, relating their detailed form to the correlation exponent
	and distinguishing boundary induced generalized Friedel oscillations
	from true charge density waves. We also discuss a different approach
	to extracting the correlation exponent from the finite size spectrum
	which uses exclusively open boundary conditions and can therefore
	take advantage of data for much larger system sizes. A general discussion
	of the Friedel oscillation wave vectors is given, and a convenient
	Fourier transform technique is used to determine it. DMRG results
	are analyzed on Hubbard and t?J chains and 2 leg t?J ladders. We
	present evidence for the existence of a long-ranged charge density
	wave state in the t?J ladder at a filling of n=0.75 and near J/ t?0.25.},

	(DMRG) calculations for the t-J model, on systems as large as 10×7,
	we examine the structure of the one and two hole ground states in
	ladder systems and in two dimensional clusters. A simple theoretical
	framework is used to explain why holes bind in pairs in two-dimensional
	antiferromagnets. For the case J/t=0.5, which we have studied, the
	hole pairs reside predominantly on a 2×2 core plaquette with the
	probability that the holes are on diagonal sites greater than nearest-neighbor
	sites. There is a strong singlet bond connecting the spins on the
	two remaining sites of the plaquette. We find that a general characteristic
	of dynamic holes in an antiferromagnet is the presence of frustrating
	antiferromagnetic bonds connecting next-nearest-neighbor sites across
	the holes. Pairs of holes bind in order to share the frustrating
	bonds. At low doping, in addition to hole pairs, there are two additional
	low-energy structures which spontaneously form on certain finite
	systems. The first is an undoped L×2 spin-liquid region, or ladder.
	The second is a hole moving along a one dimensional chain of sites.
	At higher doping we expect that hole pairing is always favored.},
